    <h1>The Birth of Jesus Christ</h1>
    <p class="datetag"><em>üï∞Ô∏è Written: December 2025</em></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>‚ÄúThe people walking in darkness have seen a great Light; on those living in the land of deep darkness, a Light has dawned.‚Äù <em>‚Äî Isaiah¬†9:2</em></p>
    </blockquote>

    <!-- Opening Image: His Star over Bethlehem -->
    <figure>
      <img id="imgOpening" src="../assets/christmas01.png" alt="Night sky over Bethlehem with His Star shining"/>
      <figcaption>‚ÄúHis Star‚Äù over Bethlehem ‚Äî the sign Heaven placed to mark the King‚Äôs arrival (Matthew¬†2).</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>The world was quiet that night ‚Äî too quiet for what was about to happen. Rome ruled with iron, prophets had been silent for centuries, and the people of Israel longed for deliverance. Yet above the stillness, Heaven was already stirring. The old prophecy of Isaiah had never stopped echoing through creation. Angels had memorized it. Stars had listened for the command. The moment had come for the Word to become flesh.</p>

    <h2>The Journey to Bethlehem</h2>
    <p>In a small town of Nazareth, a young woman named Mary carried a promise too great for human words. Beside her walked Joseph, faithful and steady, leading the donkey down the dusty road toward Bethlehem. It wasn‚Äôt just a journey of obedience to Caesar‚Äôs decree ‚Äî it was the fulfillment of prophecy:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>‚ÄúBut you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for Me one who will be ruler over Israel‚Ä¶‚Äù <em>‚Äî Micah¬†5:2</em></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Each step on that rocky path was guided by unseen hands. Heaven watched as the Savior of the world drew nearer to His appointed birthplace.</p>

    <h2>No Room, Yet Perfectly Placed</h2>
    <p>When they arrived, there was no room at the inn ‚Äî but that was no accident. God had chosen humility as the cradle of glory.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>‚ÄúBehold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and shall call His name <em>Immanuel</em>.‚Äù <em>‚Äî Isaiah¬†7:14</em></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>And so, in a quiet stable, surrounded by the scent of hay and the warmth of breath from gentle animals, the King of Kings was born. The Creator stepped into His own creation ‚Äî Heaven touched Earth. Mary wrapped Him in swaddling cloth and laid Him in a manger, not realizing that in her arms rested the Light Isaiah had seen so long ago.</p>

    <h2>His Star and the Shepherds</h2>
    <p>Above the hills, shepherds kept watch by night. The darkness they knew so well suddenly split open ‚Äî radiant, holy light filled the sky. ‚ÄúDo not be afraid,‚Äù the angel said. ‚ÄúFor behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.‚Äù The heavens erupted in song: ‚ÄúGlory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men!‚Äù</p>

    <!-- Manger Image: Heaven touches Earth -->
    <figure>
      <img id="imgManger" src="../assets/christmas02.png" alt="Mary and Joseph at the manger as His Star shines overhead" />
      <figcaption>Heaven touches Earth ‚Äî the Holy Family in the manger as His Star shines above.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>And far away, wise men lifted their eyes. Among the countless lights, one glowed unlike the rest ‚Äî steady, deliberate, alive. <strong>His Star.</strong> Not born of chance, but appointed by God to lead those who were seeking the true King.</p>

    <h2>The Light Has Come</h2>
    <p>When the Magi finally arrived, they knelt before the child, their treasures forgotten in the presence of something greater. This was the fulfillment of every prophecy, every longing, every tear shed under the weight of sin. The cradle and the cross were not far apart ‚Äî even now, in the faint glow of His first breaths, redemption was already unfolding.</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>The same Light that rose over Bethlehem still shines through every shadow today. He wasn‚Äôt just born into the world; He was born for the world ‚Äî for you, for me, for every soul who would seek Him. When you look up at the night sky this season, remember: the star that once guided wise men still points to the same truth ‚Äî <strong>The Light has come, and darkness will never overcome it.</strong></p>
