      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The book of Revelation describes <strong>seven trumpets</strong> — blasts of warning that shake the earth before the final judgment. These are not random disasters; they are <em>alarms</em>, each growing louder, each harder to ignore.</p>
      <p>If Babylon 2.0 is the <em>system</em> of control, the trumpets are the <em>alarms</em> that system cannot silence. And when you look around, it’s hard not to notice: many of these alarms have already sounded.</p>

      <h2>Trumpet 1 — Fire on the Earth</h2>
      <p><strong>Revelation 8:7</strong>: “Hail and fire mixed with blood… a third of the earth, trees, and all green grass burned up.”</p>
      <p><strong>What it says:</strong> Environmental devastation, fire falling on the land.</p>
      <p><strong>What happened:</strong> The last century has seen unprecedented destruction of forests and farmland through wars, chemical weapons, and wildfires. Nuclear bombs literally scorched earth and left land uninhabitable.</p>
      <p><strong>Checkable fact:</strong> Wildfires in Australia, California, and the Amazon are documented globally, with some regions losing up to a third of their trees.</p>

      <h2>Trumpet 2 — Mountain in the Sea</h2>
      <p><strong>Revelation 8:8–9</strong>: “Something like a great mountain, burning with fire, was thrown into the sea… a third of the sea became blood.”</p>
      <p><strong>What it says:</strong> A massive eruption/object hitting the sea, destroying life and trade.</p>
      <p><strong>What happened:</strong> Massive volcanic eruptions (like Krakatoa, or Tonga 2022) sent shockwaves across the globe. Oil spills such as Deepwater Horizon turned seas into black death zones.</p>
      <p><strong>Checkable fact:</strong> Oil spill images show seas literally turned to “blood.” Shipping losses during wars also match this imagery.</p>

      <h2>Trumpet 3 — Wormwood</h2>
      <p><strong>Revelation 8:10–11</strong>: “A great star fell from heaven… the name of the star is Wormwood… many people died from the bitter waters.”</p>
      <p><strong>What it says:</strong> Waters poisoned, many die.</p>
      <p><strong>What happened:</strong> In 1986, the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine poisoned rivers and land. “Chernobyl” literally translates to <em>wormwood</em>. Radiation spread across Europe, poisoning water and food.</p>
      <p><strong>Checkable fact:</strong> Radiation-linked deaths from Chernobyl are still tracked today. This is one of the clearest prophecy-history alignments.</p>

      <h2>Trumpet 4 — Darkened Skies</h2>
      <p><strong>Revelation 8:12</strong>: “A third of the sun was struck… a third of the day kept from shining.”</p>
      <p><strong>What it says:</strong> Darkness covering skies.</p>
      <p><strong>What happened:</strong> Nuclear explosions, volcanic ash clouds, and industrial smog have blotted out the sun. The Gulf War oil fires in 1991 turned Middle Eastern skies black for months.</p>
      <p><strong>Checkable fact:</strong> NASA records show measurable sunlight dimming during these events.</p>

      <h2>Trumpet 5 — The Locusts and the Wars of Torment</h2>
      <p><strong>Revelation 9:1–6</strong>: “The Abyss opened… out came locusts… they were told not to kill, but to torment five months… people will seek death but not find it.”</p>
      <p><strong>What it says:</strong> Torment without annihilation. Strange locust-like forces swarming the earth, stinging like scorpions.</p>
      <p><strong>What we see:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Global war tension</strong> — Ukraine vs Russia, U.S. vs Venezuela, China circling Taiwan. The world lives in constant war-anxiety; headlines warn of “World War III” daily.</li>
        <li><strong>The Gaza war</strong> — A spiritual tragedy: Christians killing Christians on holy ground. Palestinian believers caught between sides while other Christians cheer for bombs to fall. This is happening in the very land Revelation points to.</li>
        <li><strong>Torment, not death</strong> — Drone warfare, chemical attacks, and drawn-out conflicts wound and torment without ending humanity. Mental torment spreads globally through depression, addiction, and pharmakeia.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Checkable fact:</strong> Drone warfare, mental health stats, and the Gaza war are documented daily.</p>
      <p class="trumpet-now">We are here: The Fifth Trumpet is sounding. Wars torment, but the world has not yet burned to ash. Humanity is living in the sting.</p>

      <h2>Trumpet 6 — The Euphrates Hourglass</h2>
      <p><strong>Revelation 9:13–15</strong>: “The sixth angel… released the four angels bound at the great river Euphrates… to kill a third of mankind.”</p>
      <p><strong>What it says:</strong> A catastrophic release, armies in the hundreds of millions, a third of humanity killed.</p>
      <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Revelation usually speaks in symbols, but here it names a place directly: <em>the Euphrates River</em>. That makes this prophecy stand out like a red flare.</p>
      <p><strong>What we see:</strong> The Euphrates is literally drying up. Satellite images confirm it. Villages now walk across its cracked bed. Revelation 16 ties this drying to preparations for the final war.</p>
      <p><strong>Checkable fact:</strong> Search “Euphrates River drying up.” Mainstream outlets and NASA confirm it.</p>
      <p><strong>The meaning:</strong> The drying Euphrates is the <em>hourglass of prophecy</em>. When the water is gone, what was bound there will be released. It is the only geographic marker Revelation gave us — impossible to ignore.</p>

      <h2>Trumpet 7 — The Final Blast</h2>
      <p><strong>Revelation 11:15</strong>: “The seventh angel sounded… voices in heaven said, ‘The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ.’”</p>
      <p><strong>What it says:</strong> The final handover — God’s kingdom replaces man’s. Lightning, thunder, earthquakes, judgment follow.</p>
      <p><strong>Not yet:</strong> This has not sounded. When it does, the alarms end and the war is over.</p>

      <h2>Closing Thought</h2>
      <p>The trumpets are not just prophecy — they are a pattern. And that pattern is already echoing through history.</p>
      <p>Chernobyl means Wormwood. The Euphrates is drying. Drones swarm like locusts. Oil fires darken skies. None of this is speculation. All of it can be seen, measured, or remembered.</p>
      <p><strong>We are living in the echo of the Fifth Trumpet. And with the Euphrates running dry, the Sixth is not far behind.</strong></p>
      <p>The alarms are sounding. The question is whether we will hear them — before the final blast.</p>
