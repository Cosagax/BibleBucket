    <h1 class="title">We’re living in a post‑flood World, but being taught like we’re in a never‑flooded World.</h1>
    <p class="date">🕰️ Written: October 2025</p>

    <p class="lede">The story of Noah’s Flood isn’t a legend about a man and a boat. It’s the record of a world that was judged, drowned, and reshaped — the same world we’re standing on right now. Every canyon, fossil bed, and mountain range is a scar from that reset.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Before and After the Flood</h2>
      <figure>
        <img id="prePostImg" src="../assets/flood001.png" alt="Split scene of the lush pre-Flood world under the firmament vs. the harsh post-Flood landscape">
        <figcaption><em>Before the Deluge</em> — the Earth beneath the firmament (left) and the scarred world that emerged after (right). The Flood didn’t just wash the Earth — it reshaped it.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The world before the Flood was different: balanced climate, longer lifespans, a protective firmament canopy, and peace between man and creation. Then the fountains of the deep burst open, the firmament collapsed, and the world’s surface convulsed. When the waters receded, continents had shifted, mountains had risen, and lifespans fell. We live on the broken half of what used to be paradise.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Bible’s Own Record</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Why judgment came:</strong> “The earth was corrupt and filled with violence.” (Genesis 6:11–12)</li>
        <li><strong>Warning and obedience:</strong> “By faith Noah… constructed an ark.” (Hebrews 11:7)</li>
        <li><strong>What broke open:</strong> “The fountains of the great deep burst forth, and the windows of heaven were opened.” (Genesis 7:11)</li>
        <li><strong>Extent:</strong> “All the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered.” (Genesis 7:19)</li>
        <li><strong>Duration:</strong> The waters prevailed 150 days; Noah was in the ark for over a year. (Genesis 7–8)</li>
        <li><strong>Survivors:</strong> “Only Noah was left, and those who were with him in the ark.” (Genesis 7:23)</li>
        <li><strong>Covenant:</strong> “Never again destroy all flesh by water” — sealed with the rainbow. (Genesis 9:11)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Jesus treated the Flood as literal history (Matthew 24:37), Peter tied it to the coming fire (2&nbsp;Peter 3:6–7), and Enoch warned of it beforehand. The bow in the clouds is not just a symbol of hope — it is a contract remembered in the sky.</p>
      <p><em>Enoch, who walked with God before the Flood, was shown visions of it in advance. His book records God’s command to cleanse the earth of corruption and the coming “judgment of the Flood” (1 Enoch 10; 67). The warning passed through his line to Noah, who carried it out in obedience.</em></p>

      <h2>The Evidence Around Us</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Marine fossils on mountaintops</strong> — seashells on Everest, limestone through the Rockies.</li>
        <li><strong>Global sedimentary layers</strong> — miles thick, pancake‑flat across continents.</li>
        <li><strong>Fossil graveyards</strong> — billions of animals entombed together, rapidly buried.</li>
        <li><strong>Megaflood landscapes</strong> — Grand Canyon, Channeled Scablands, and more.</li>
        <li><strong>Cultural memory</strong> — 200+ flood traditions tell the same story of judgment and renewal.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Water Marks of a World Reset</h2>
      <figure>
        <img id="worldMapImg" src="../assets/flood002.png" alt="World map with pale-blue overlay indicating global flood signatures">
        <figcaption>Pale blue shows regions bearing the marks of catastrophic inundation — water lines from a world reset.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Sediment layers, marine fossils, and flood plains stretch across every continent. It’s as if the planet was washed, wrung out, and then left to dry. The Flood wasn’t local — it was total. And the world that came after is the one we now mistake for “ancient.”</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What the Flood Really Means</h2>
      <p>If the Flood happened — and it did — then judgment is not a myth. The first world perished by water; Peter says this one will end by fire. We’re living between two judgments, under a sky that once poured down wrath and will one day blaze again. But there’s mercy in that memory: Noah found grace. The ark was God’s invitation to anyone willing to believe before the rain came. That same invitation still stands.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Closing Thought</h2>
      <p>The Flood isn’t ancient history. It’s the boundary between the old Earth and ours. Every fossil, canyon, and ripple mark is a receipt of what God already did — and a warning of what’s still to come.</p>
